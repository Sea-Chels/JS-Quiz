# JS-Quiz
## Description
The purpose of this project was to make a quiz mostly using javascript. I struggled with this a lot because I felt like I didn't know javascript that well and getting started was a real doozy for me, it took me much longer than expected because I was not confident in my javascript. I think that even though for a good sum of this project I followed a tutorial, I learned a lot in the process and am now more confident in using javascript. There are still lots of things that confuse me, but I think I'm able to look at documentation easier and understand it better now because of this project. 
I also think that it was necessary for me to continue learning and using javascript in class for me to be able to complete this project. There were some things covered in later weeks helped me to understand better what I was doing with this project. 
## Usage
This is quiz made from javascript, so you need to first open up the page and press start. Once you do that you just need to just continue answering the questions then press next. Once you get to the end of the quiz you will see two buttons, one to restart the quiz, and one to show you your results. If you hit restart, you will start over, and your results will NOT be stored in local storage. if you results then you will be shown your score and it will be stored in local storage.
